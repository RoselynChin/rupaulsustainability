            Tip 1: Start composting
        </h3>
        <p>
            So much food is thrown away, but some of that can be turned into compost, which will help your garden and the ecosystem. This is a great way to repurpose your food scraps such as onion peels and rotten vegetables to a better method of fertilization. RuPaul hates touching the worms and bugs that fester in his compost, but he makes this sacrifice for Mother (Earth).

                Tip 2: Go thrifting
            </h3>
            <p>
                Shein and Forever 21 are both affordable, but both are the forefront of the fast fashion industry. People spend a lot of money on clothes every month (RuPaul is guilty of this) and buy new clothes often. By going to secondhand stores for anything such as furniture and clothing, you will be giving an older item a new purpose and a new home! RuPaul got one of his suits from a local Salvation Army decades ago, and since then, he has never looked back.

                    Tip 3: Use Reusable Containers
                </h3>
                <p>
                    RuPaul briefly mentioned containers in the "Reuse" section, but he is mentioning them again. Containers are so important for RuPaul's lunch special - skinny salad. Disposable plates and utensils angers RuPaul. The immense amount of waste that can be avoided with reusable containers and washing your dishes would make a difference. If you still like disposable containers, RuPaul will tell you to "Sashay away."
